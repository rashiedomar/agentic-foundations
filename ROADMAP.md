## üéØ Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current - Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Understand what agents are and how they work

**Lessons:**
- [x] Lesson 1: What is an AI Agent?
- [ ] Lesson 2: The Agent Loop
- [ ] Lesson 3: Memory Systems
- [ ] Lesson 4: Building First Agent

**Projects to Build:**
- [ ] Simple reflection agent (self-critique loop)
- [ ] Task-solver CLI (basic planner + executor)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- Perceive ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect cycle
- Difference between reactive and proactive systems
- Basic agent architecture

---

### Phase 2: Core Components (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal:** Build reusable agent modules

**Focus Areas:**
- Memory systems (vector stores, episodic memory)
- Tool integration (APIs, search, code execution)
- Planning & reasoning strategies
- Error handling and recovery

**Modules to Build:**
- [ ] `src/memory/` - Memory management system
- [ ] `src/tools/` - Tool wrapper library
- [ ] `src/planner/` - Basic reasoning engine
- [ ] `src/executor/` - Safe tool execution

---

### Phase 3: Real Agents (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal:** Build working agents for actual use cases

**Agents to Build:**
- [ ] **Research Assistant** - Summarizes papers, finds related work
- [ ] **Dev Agent** - Writes, runs, and debugs code
- [ ] **Data Analyst Agent** - Analyzes datasets and creates reports

**Skills to Develop:**
- Multi-step task planning
- Tool chaining and composition
- Result validation and quality checks

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Weeks 11-16)
**Goal:** Multi-agent systems and production readiness

**Topics:**
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Agent communication protocols
- Environment interfaces (browser, CLI, APIs)
- Evaluation and metrics
- Safety and guardrails

**Projects:**
- [ ] Team of agents working together
- [ ] Agent with browser control
- [ ] Performance benchmarking system

---

### Phase 5: Domain Applications (Weeks 17+)
**Goal:** Build agents for my specific interests

**Ideas:**
- SomaliGPT research agent
- Crosswalk safety decision agent
- Education mentor agent
- Personal productivity agent

---

## üìä Progress Metrics

### Overall Progress
- **Lessons Completed:** 1 / 10+
- **Prototypes Built:** 0 / 5  
- **Hours Learning:** ~3 hours
- **Days Active:** 1

### Skills Acquired
- [x] Understanding agent vs model distinction
- [ ] Building basic agent loops
- [ ] Implementing memory systems
- [ ] Tool integration
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination

---

## üí≠ Learning Journal

### Week 1 (Jan 15-21, 2025)
**What I learned:**
- Agents are autonomous, models are reactive
- The core loop: Perceive ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect
- Agents need tools to interact with the world

**Breakthroughs:**
- Finally understand why ChatGPT can't "just Google it" - it's a model, not an agent!

**Challenges:**
- So many frameworks to choose from (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen...)
- Not sure where to start with actually building

**Next week's focus:**
- Dive deep into the agent loop
- Build my first simple agent
- Pick one framework to learn

---

### Week 2 (Jan 22-28, 2025)
*To be filled in...*

---

## üîÑ Flexible Learning Notes

This roadmap is **not rigid**. I'll adjust as I:
- Discover new resources
- Find topics that need more depth  
- Get interested in specific applications
- Hit roadblocks that need extra time

**The goal is learning, not checking boxes.**

---

## üìö Resources I'm Using

### Courses
- [ ] DeepLearning.AI - AI Agents in LangGraph
- [ ] Andrew Ng's Agentic AI course

### Frameworks to Explore
- LangGraph (orchestration)
- CrewAI (multi-agent)
- AutoGen (agent conversations)
- LlamaIndex (RAG + agents)

### Papers to Read
- [ ] ReAct: Reasoning + Acting
- [ ] AutoGPT paper
- [ ] Tool use papers from OpenAI/Anthropic

### Communities
- LangChain Discord
- Agentic AI Twitter
- GitHub discussions

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

I'll know I'm succeeding when I can:
- [ ] Explain agents clearly to others
- [ ] Build agents that solve real problems
- [ ] Debug agent failures systematically
- [ ] Contribute to open-source agent projects
- [ ] Use agents in my daily workflow

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on understanding deeply, not moving fast.
