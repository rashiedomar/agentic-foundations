## 💭 Learning Journal

### Week 1-4 (January 2025)
**What I learned:**
- Agents are autonomous, models are reactive
- The core loop: Perceive → Plan → Act → Reflect
- Agents need memory to maintain context
- Different types of memory serve different purposes

**Breakthroughs:**
- Finally understand why ChatGPT can't "just Google it" - it's a model, not an agent!
- Grasped the importance of the agent loop
- Built my first working agent

**Challenges:**
- So many frameworks to choose from
- Understanding memory systems in practice

---

### Recent Progress (October 2025)
**What I learned:**
- **Planning is what makes agents intelligent**
- Chain-of-Thought for linear problems
- Tree-of-Thoughts for exploring tradeoffs
- ReAct pattern for iterative tool use
- Task decomposition and dependency management
- How to build production-ready planning systems

**Breakthroughs:**
- Understanding when to use which planning strategy
- Building a complete planning agent with multiple strategies
- Creating both learning (notebook) and production (prototype) code
- Seeing how planning enables complex multi-step tasks

**Code Achievements:**
- ✅ Built `planning_agent.py` with full planning system
- ✅ Created interactive experiments in notebook
- ✅ Implemented task dependencies and topological sorting
- ✅ Added error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Built tool registry system

**Challenges:**
- Understanding how different strategies complement each other
