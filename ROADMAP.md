## 💭 Learning Journal

### Week 1-4 (January 2025)
**What I learned:**
- Agents are autonomous, models are reactive
- The core loop: Perceive → Plan → Act → Reflect
- Agents need memory to maintain context
- Different types of memory serve different purposes

**Breakthroughs:**
- Finally understand why ChatGPT can't "just Google it" - it's a model, not an agent!
- Grasped the importance of the agent loop
- Built my first working agent

**Challenges:**
- So many frameworks to choose from
- Understanding memory systems in practice
