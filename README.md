# 🤖 Agentic Foundations

> My journey learning to build autonomous AI agents from scratch

This repository documents everything I'm learning about **agentic AI systems** - AI that can reason, plan, use tools, and act autonomously to achieve goals.

## 🎯 What This Repo Is About

This is a **learning-in-public** repository where I:
- Document core concepts as I learn them
- Build progressively complex agents
- Share code examples and experiments
- Track my progress and reflections

**Not a polished framework** - this is raw learning, experiments, and notes as I figure things out.

## 📚 Lessons

Each lesson builds on the previous ones. Start from Lesson 1 if you're new to agentic AI.

### Phase 1: Foundations
- **Lesson 1:** [What is an AI Agent?](lessons/01-what-is-an-agent.md) - Understanding agents vs models vs tools
- **Lesson 2:** [The Agent Loop](lessons/02-agent-loop.md) - Perceive → Plan → Act → Reflect cycle
- **Lesson 3:** [Memory Systems](lessons/03-memory-systems.md) - Short-term, long-term, and episodic memory
- **Lesson 4:** [First Agent](lessons/04-first-agent.md) - Building a simple reflection agent

### Phase 2: Core Components  
- **Lesson 5:** [Planning & Reasoning](lessons/05-planning.md) - Task decomposition and tool selection
- **Lesson 6:** [Tool Integration](lessons/06-tools.md) - Giving agents capabilities
- **Lesson 7:** [Error Handling](lessons/07-error-handling.md) - Making agents robust

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- **Lesson 8:** [Multi-Agent Systems](lessons/08-multi-agent.md) - Agents working together
- **Lesson 9:** [Environment Interfaces](lessons/09-environments.md) - Connecting agents to the real world
- **Lesson 10:** [Evaluation](lessons/10-evaluation.md) - Measuring agent performance

## 📖 Resources I'm Learning From

- LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen documentation
- Research papers on agent architectures
- OpenAI, Anthropic agent documentation
- Community tutorials and projects

## 🎓 My Learning Goals

By the end of this journey, I want to:
- [ ] Understand how modern AI agents work under the hood
- [ ] Build agents that can plan and execute multi-step tasks
- [ ] Create agents for real-world use cases (research, coding, data analysis)
- [ ] Contribute to the agentic AI community

## 🗺️ Progress Tracker

Check [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for my detailed learning plan and what I'm currently working on.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is my personal learning repo, but if you're learning too:
- Open issues to discuss concepts
- Share resources via PRs
- Fork and create your own learning journey!
